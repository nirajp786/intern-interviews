              <p>I am a Computer Science student attending University of Windsor for Bachelors in Computer Science with Software Engineering specialization.</p>

              <h1>What I want from this internship?</h1>
              <p>From this internship my main goal is to develop new skills and simply become a better software engineer. One of the most
                  interesing thing that I am excited to learn at this internship is Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing has always been one of my
                  weakest area due to this I enrolled in multiple course to learn about Google Cloud Platform (GCP) but this internship will allow
                  me to get hand-on experience with is. Another thing that I want to learn is backend and frontend development, I think the use of React
                  will allow me to get a more deeper understanding that I have from my own person projects. Another important aspect is that I want
                  learn more regarding the Software Engineering culture, as my past experience in Embedded Software Development I want to move more towards
                  Software Engineering and gain expereince in that area.

              <h1>What it means to be Software Engineer</h1>
              <p>To me being a Software Engineer is more than just coding or building applications. To me its more than that, I personally see
                  Software Engineering as a way, an opportunity to create something meaningful for our society. Software Engineering gives me the
                  ability to shape my society the way I want to, allows me to create something for a better tomorrow because of this I love working
                  on meaningful projects that have good impact on others lives.
